Android Interview At-home Assignment
================================================================================

Make a simple Android "quiz" app.  Spend 2-3 hours on it, and stop.  It is OK if 
the app is not complete or perfect - part of the exercise is to see where you 
stop (if you did not finish) and what parts you chose to prioritize. We can then 
discuss those decisions and what you would have done with more time.  

## Implementation Details
1. On launch of the app, parse the JSON (included later on this page) and 
present the first question and available answers.
2. Answers should be presented in a 2x2 grid, and not in a vertical list.
3. If you are comfortable With Jetpack Compose for your UI, please use that. 
4. Provide a “selected” visual state for an answer when tapped (like a colored
stroke around the answer, as an example).  If there was already a selected 
answer, the prior answer should be deselected and the new answer selected. 
5. When pressing the submit button, provide an alert or some indication if the 
answer was correct or not. 
6. Then move on to the next question.  Repeat until all questions have been 
answered. 
7. If you have time and are feeling fancy, provide a final screen indicating 
overall score from the quiz and a button to start over.
